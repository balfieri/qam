<p>
This repository contains a C++ program that simulates N-QAM where N is currently restricted to 4 or 16 (default is 16).  
</p>

<p>
N-QAM is a two-dimensional multi-level signaling technique that uses two clocks separated by a quarter cycle, i.e., an in-phase clock and 
an quadrature clock.  N-QAM is used extensively in RF applications, but can also be used in purely electrical transmissions.
</p>

<p>
N-QAM is more robust than one-dimensional multi-level signaling techniques such as PAM-N.
